# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most tragic maritime disasters in history. Over 1,500 people died, while only 700 survived. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger would have survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and family size.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is the Titanic Passenger Dataset, which is available on the Kaggle website. The dataset contains information on over 2,200 passengers, including their name, age, sex, ticket class, fare paid, cabin number, and whether they survived.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This includes cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for the model. Some of the preprocessing steps include:

* **Handling missing values:** Some of the data entries in the dataset are missing. These missing values need to be handled in a way that does not affect the training of the model. One common way to handle missing values is to impute the missing values with the mean or median value of the corresponding column.

* **Converting categorical variables:** Some of the variables in the dataset are categorical, such as sex, cabin number, and embarked port. These categorical variables need to be converted into numerical values so that they can be used by the machine learning model. This can be done using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.

* **Scaling numerical variables:** Some of the numerical variables in the dataset, such as age and fare paid, have different scales. These variables need to be scaled to a common scale so that they do not have a disproportionate impact on the training of the model. This can be done using techniques such as normalization or standardization.

## Feature Engineering

In addition to preprocessing the data, we can also engineer new features that may be useful for predicting survival. For example, we can create a feature that indicates whether a passenger was traveling alone or with family members. We can also create a feature that indicates whether a passenger was in a first-class, second-class, third-class, or fourth-class cabin.

## Machine Learning Model

Once the data has been preprocessed and engineered, we can train a machine learning model to predict survival. There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for this task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

## Evaluation

After training the machine learning model, we need to evaluate its performance on a held-out test set. This will help us determine how well the model generalizes to new data. There are many different metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This project has demonstrated how to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger would have survived the sinking of the Titanic. The model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the held-out test set.
